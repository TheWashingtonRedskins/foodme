<p>When it comes to your night out, you shouldn't have to do any thinking. That's where foodme comes in. We want to take the hassle out of choosing where to eat. foodme intelligently decides where you should eat and tells you everything you need to know to get there!</p>

<p>We'll get to know you and your eating habits and we will recommend a restaurant for you through machine learning! We utilize the yelp api and google maps api to bring your information to you, but developed our own algorithm for determining where you want to go next! The model is simple and clutter free, we want to to tell what you want to know and nothing more. Possible Facebook integration to come soon.</p>
